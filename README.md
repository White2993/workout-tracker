I don't appreciate how this program did so much of the code. Even though it would take more time, it would've been much more beneficial to build it from scratch. I can say that because I didn't have to do it.

Aside from that this project actually wasn't too difficult. (Although I still needed plenty of help from classmates.) The thing that ate up most of my time was trying to figure out how to tie the last route in particular. It boiled completely down to arrow vs. regular functions. 

PROCESS:
1. Setting up the server.
2. Setting up routes to see different pages.
3. Setting up routes to allow content to be posted successfully into the console.
4. Fixing errors with arrow functions vs. regular ones.
5. Making sure data and display rendered properly.

Time to completion: 6ish hours? I watched a few tutorials.
